I highlight some recent ones here which show my latest skills. The decisions behind the coding and hosting choices can be found in their individual blog posts (upcoming). For now, feel free to explore them on GitHub!\nFLOWS Astronomy image analysis pipeline https://github.com/SNFLOWS\nUtilized Python, Linux, Git, GitHub, bash, Cron, SQL, PostGreSQL,\nDocker to create data reduction pipeline that has served over\n100,000 photometric measurements.\nRawSightML Raw python/numpy (vectorized), object-oriented, Machine Learning library https://github.com/emirkmo/rawsight_ML\nImplemented acceptance tests against Tensorflow and Scikit-\nLearn.\nUsed SOLID design principles to make easily extensible and\nreadable code to provide insight into ML algorithms, with\ninterfaces defined by Protocol classes.\nImplemented Linear, Logistic, Softmax, Polynomial regression,\nnormalizers, cost functions, regularization, batch gradient descent,\nsequential and convolutional neural nets with dense layers, back\npropagation, decision trees.\nastroSN Python pandas based, typed, extensible, supernova time-series analysis and plotting library Reduced on-boarding time for new students into bachelor\nresearch projects by two weeks by publishing on PyPi (pip) a\nsupernova time-series analysis library, also containing an ETL\nphotometry ingest pipeline, using easy to extend abstract classes\nand protocols.\ntnsquery asychronous REST API for transient data queries developed with FASTAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Docker https://github.com/emirkmo/tnsquery\nImplemented a local postgreSQL database as a caching/main\ndatabase, external private API as central-authority service, and\ndeployed with docker containers using Portainer for container\nmanagement on self-built bare-metal Linux server, served via\nCloudFlare tunnels instead of nginx reverse proxy. Will be\nimplemented into large open-source community Astropy package\nto provide limited-authentication API queries not possible via the\nofficial API, which is locked behind professional astronomer\ncredentials page.\nFull python packaging eco-system with poetry, pip, pre-commit\nhooks mypy, black, flake8, Alembic migrations, github actions, dev\nand deployment containers\nTendrils Python API wrapper around PHP webserver API Developed simple API to give researchers programmatic access to data products of FLOWS pipeline and related external APIs.\nflows_get_brightest Astronomy observational planner python script to query catalogs, intelligently place instrument on sky to\navoid bright stars, and produce finder charts.\nObject-oriented grid-graph algorithm solutions in Python Object oriented standard grid-graph (island) traversal algorithms,\nimplemented with multi-D breadth first and depth first search,\nallowing for non-standard path-traversal logic, in simple to read\nand extend raw python.\nSelected Open Source Contributions - Astropy: Made Extended CSV (ECSV) v.1.0 backwards compatibile\nwith v0.9, added regression tests, allowing many projects to finally\nupgrade to the latest version of Astropy.\n- SVOFilters: Added data validation and cleaning to the web API for\nqueries resulting in non-monotonically increasing bandpass filter\nprofiles, and for N repeated entries using BFS; made errors more\nspecific.\n- Pyscript: Contributed How-To guide on making async HTTP\nrequests using PyScript and pyodide using JavaScript Fetch API,\nusing a pure python wrapper, addressing the most commonly\nasked issue and question of the missing requests module.\n- Scikit-Learn: Made Gaussian Mixture Model initialization more\nrobust by allowing passing in user-provided callables and\nsimplified the model inputs, provided docs, regression tests, and\nincreased test coverage of sklearn.mixture module.\n- Photutils: Found, reproduced, diagnosed, and fixed bug with\npoint-spread-function centroid finding algorithm and added\nregression tests.\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome ðŸ‘‹","tags":[],"title":"Welcome to my website","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, youâ€™ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
